# Ubiquiti Networks Presentation - Craig Martin

Assumptions and things I would fix:

The policies in the Beanstalk setup are pretty open, I would tighten them up in staging and production.

I would have the deployment code in a separate repo from the application code for best practices, for demo/presentation it is ok and keeps things simple.
